## I’m Roland J. Baron

### About Me

I'm on a mission to build a career in Cybersecurity—a journey fueled by curiosity, grit, 
and relentless self-improvement. With a strong academic foundation through BYU Pathways and
Ensign College and practical skills in system administration, scripting, and networking, 
I’m steadily moving toward roles in SOC analysis, penetration testing, or cloud security.

"Persist until you succeed." That’s the principle I live and work by.
